3 bullet points on visible differences:

- Ending sections are not aligned properly. I can't understand why it is not aligned.
- There were some padding/spacing issues, a little issue about the spacing stuff
- In the mobile version I have included the hamburger menu. but in the design, there wasn't any accordion, I think, or I think I have missed it
